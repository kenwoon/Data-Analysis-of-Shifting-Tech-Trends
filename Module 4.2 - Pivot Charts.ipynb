Pivot charts play a crucial role in data analytics by enabling quick and intuitive exploration of multidimensional datasets. They allow analysts to summarize and visualize complex data relationships across multiple variables, facilitating insights that might be obscured in raw data tables. By dynamically aggregating and pivoting data, these charts provide a comprehensive view of trends, patterns, and correlations, empowering decision-makers to identify key factors influencing outcomes. Pivot charts enhance data-driven decision-making processes by simplifying complex data into actionable visual representations, thereby accelerating understanding and fostering informed strategies in diverse fields such as business analytics, market research, and scientific studies.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"98f822ff-b4a1-4b31-a6ec-1027da8759b7","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab you will be able to:\n","\n"," - Use Pivot charts for data analytics\n"," - Use different types of charts for different scenarios\n"," - Make deeper inferences from data based on the pivoted representations\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"48ba1dcf-5f7e-4365-82b4-d31bd8fb01cf","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["----\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"be93e397-2d60-4fa6-ba46-23bfdc87a918","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b993fb32-5629-427b-97dd-41fcd2e02dbd","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:\n","\n","*   [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for managing the data.\n","*   [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for visualizing the data.\n","*   [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for additional plotting tools.\n","*   [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) for accessing the database\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1ac4c125-a312-4322-990f-29ccf25bfec4","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Installing Required Libraries\n","\n","Execute the following code to install the required libraries on the interface\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"3e2cdf01-5249-4d54-b758-ec0e490389e8","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%pip install pandas seaborn"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d095a404-67a6-44f7-976b-f0e5565f22da","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Importing Required Libraries\n","\n","All libraries required for the codes below should be imported here.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"11fec6d3-89ad-416e-be34-4a30bbeec27c","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\nimport sqlite3\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6d3814d3-6a05-4859-9865-71df88175759","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Download the database\n","Download the databaset from the cloud server by executing the code statement below.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"9ac9ce41-b298-48ce-9016-ed09eb1d0fc4","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["!wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m4_survey_data.sqlite"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"80a70e57-3c5c-4c10-b79c-0afbe11bd2a5","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["Load the database and read the data table as a Pandas dataframe for further usage, by executing the following code.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"2de80496-f154-49f9-a39d-2c184bffa2d5","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["conn = sqlite3.connect(\"m4_survey_data.sqlite\") # open a database connection\nQUERY = \"\"\"SELECT * FROM master\"\"\"\ndf = pd.read_sql(QUERY,conn)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9316b0a9-4178-4b93-b969-51d8d2304f24","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Scenario 1: Distribution of Respondents by Career Satisfaction and Job Satisfaction\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"affdd392-7418-4a48-bb87-cebc45977c81","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["In the first task, you can plot a distribution of the distribution of the respondents in terms of their Career Satisfaction and Job satisfaction.
